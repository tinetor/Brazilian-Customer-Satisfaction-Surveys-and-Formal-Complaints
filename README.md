# Brazilian-Customer-Satisfaction-Surveys-and-Formal-Complaints
In Brazil customers commonly complain about the lack of consistent connectivity to telephonic services. However, most companies advertise and promote their service to have top customer satisfaction proven by surveyed data. Using this context as motivation we bring the question of how do telephonic services perform compared to other services? To answer this question and the ones that arise from industry data exploratory analysis, we are going to analyze a dataset from the Brazil's consumer protection agency.
This project aims at collecting, cleaning and correcting anomalies from governmental data by using data exploratory and visualizing. The language we use is Python and its packagesâ€”Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
Questions: How do telephonic services perform compared to other services? Is the survey satisfaction reliable? Do the questions capture the main complaints? Is there a difference in the results in different states? The telephone sector is also the top rank complaint in all the states? Is there a correlation between non-specialized stores and customer complaints?
